/**
 * Fail when the SPA shell the API worker serves is missing or self-inconsistent.
 *
 * Provenance: Durable-DAV's and Durable-DAV-Router's `scripts/verify-spa-shell.mjs`
 * and Edge-Sonic's typed `scripts/build/verify-spa-shell.ts`. The rules — which of
 * the ways a shell can be wrong to look for — live in `spa-shell.ts`, so they are
 * unit tested without a build on disk; this file is the entrypoint that turns the
 * verdict into an exit code.
 *
 * What it catches:
 *
 * - the `postinstall` stub, or no build at all, still in place;
 * - `spa-shell.ts` referencing `/assets/...` bundles that were not emitted (a
 *   partially cleaned or half-copied `dist/`, which serves a shell whose JS 404s
 *   and therefore renders no operator UI at all);
 * - `spa-shell.ts` and `apps/web/dist/index.html` disagreeing, i.e. only one of
 *   the two halves of the build was refreshed.
 *
 * **The build is a precondition of this check, not a convenience.** Both paths are
 * gitignored and `postinstall` writes a deliberately empty stub, so verifying
 * without building cannot pass — and it fails with precisely the message above,
 * which is the check working rather than the check being wrong.
 *
 * Usage, from the repo root:
 *
 * ```bash
 * pnpm exec tsx scripts/verify-spa-shell.ts            # defaults to ./ as root
 * pnpm exec tsx scripts/verify-spa-shell.ts --root /path/to/repo
 * ```
