/**
 * Validate that every locale bundle carries exactly the base locale's keys.
 *
 * Provenance: `scripts/validate_locales.{mjs,ts}` in Durable-DAV, Edge-Git and
 * Mail-Meow, and Edge-Sonic's `scripts/i18n/locale-checks.ts` +
 * `validate_locales.ts`, converged. All four copies agree on the contract:
 * flattened dotted key paths, two-way parity (missing AND extra), no empty values,
 * no stray placeholders.
 *
 * ### What the convergence added
 *
 * Edge-Sonic's is the only copy that checks what a value *is*. The rest compare
 * bundle to bundle, so with one shipped language the whole per-tag body is skipped
 * and the script reports `ALL OK` having checked nothing about the application — it
 * could not see that `libraries.scanPausedRequests` was used and absent, because
 * the string in the bundle did not exist to be wrong *about* anything. Hence
 * `--call-sites`: every `t('key')` under `apps/web/src` must resolve.
 *
 * Key **order** drift against the base is a warning, not a failure: locale files
 * are maintained by mirroring new keys into every file, and failing on order would
 * turn an otherwise-correct translation update into a CI failure about formatting.
 *
 * ### Three on-disk shapes, one checker
 *
 * The family ships bundles in three shapes, and the shape is an argument rather
 * than a fork of the script:
 *
 * - `auto` (default) — every layout below, tried in order, so a repo that has
 *   half-migrated is reported rather than silently skipped;
 * - `dir` — `<locales-dir>/<tag>/translation.json`, the i18next layout used by
 *   seven repos;
 * - `file` — `<locales-dir>/<tag>.json`, one flat file per tag;
 * - `module` — `<locales-dir>/<tag>.ts` exporting an object literal, which is the
 *   shape `@rexezuge/i18n` uses for the backend string bundles. The literal is
 *   extracted and normalised here, so the same gate covers the backend catalogs
 *   the kit ships and the SPA bundles the repos do.

CLI entry: `validateLocalesCli(['[locales-dir]?', '--shape=auto|dir|file|module'?, '--base=<tag>'?, '--call-sites=<src-dir>'?, '--tags=<file>'?])`.

`--call-sites=<dir>` opts into the application-side checks: every `t('key')` under
`<dir>` must resolve against the base bundle, and any inline default must equal the
bundled value. Without the flag the script stays bundle-to-bundle, because that is
the only part it can answer for a repo whose bundles are consumed by something
other than `t()` — a backend string table, for instance.

`--tags=<file>` cross-checks a declared `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` / `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`
array against the bundle directories, in both directions. It is separate from
`--call-sites` because a repo can declare its tags in a file the scan never walks,
and a directory of bundles with no declaration is exactly the state a
bundle-to-bundle check reports as perfectly healthy.
