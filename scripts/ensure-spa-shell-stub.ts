/**
 * Write a placeholder `apps/api/src/generated/spa-shell.ts` when it is absent.
 *
 * Provenance: Durable-DAV's `scripts/ensure-spa-shell-stub.mjs` and Edge-Sonic's
 * `scripts/build/ensure-spa-shell-stub.ts`. The rule lives in `spa-shell.ts`; this
 * is the entrypoint that runs it from `postinstall`.
 *
 * `pnpm install` runs this before `typegen` so the API worker typechecks in a
 * fresh clone, where the real file has not been produced by the Vite build yet.
 * It exits having done nothing when the file already exists, so a real build
 * output is never overwritten — overwriting would erase the last build with a
 * stub on the next install. The file is gitignored.
 *
 * Usage, from the repo root (typically wired as `postinstall`):
 *
 * ```bash
 * pnpm exec tsx scripts/ensure-spa-shell-stub.ts [repo-root]
 * ```
